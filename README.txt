Getting all dependencies:

  * After cloning git@gitorious.org:pdlib/pd-for-android.git, cd into the
    pd-for-android directory and say
      git submodule init
      git submodule update
    This step will download the C sources and low-level Java libraries.

Some general hints regarding quirks of the Android SDK and Eclipse:

 * Make sure to use Eclipse 3.7 or later, as well as a recent version of the
   Android SDK and ADT
 * If you are experiencing problems with Eclipse or the Android Development
   Kit, take a look at this page: http://gitorious.org/pdlib/pages/Eclipse
